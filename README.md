CropDoc - A crop disease classification system using machine learning technology is aimed at 
developing a system that can automatically classify images of crops into different disease 
categories using machine learning algorithms. The system is intended to help farmers in 
Bangladesh detect crop diseases early, so that they can take prompt action to minimize crop 
losses.
The system has images of crops with different diseases. A user can upload a photo of infected 
leaf of the plant. It will then use a machine learning model to recognize the visual features that 
distinguish healthy crops from those with different diseases. With this specific disease can be 
found and with that they can take effective measurement for that disease. Since pesticides and 
fertilizers used for prevention of crop disease are different from one disease to another, this 
system will be very helpful.
Functionality of the project: 
Image acquisition: The system can acquire images of diseased crops from various sources such 
as smartphones, cameras, or drones.
Image pre-processing: The system can pre-process images to enhance their quality and make 
them suitable for analysis.
Feature extraction: The system can extract features from the images using various techniques 
such as image segmentation, texture analysis, and color analysis.
Disease classification: The system can classify the crops into different disease categories such as 
bacterial, fungal, or viral diseases based on the features extracted and analyzed.
The system has several potential benefits, including the ability to provide farmers with early 
warning of crop diseases and targeted recommendations for disease prevention and management. 
The project also has the potential to improve crop yields and reduce the economic losses 
associated with crop diseases.
